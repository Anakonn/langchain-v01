# プライベートデータ保護付きQA

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/docs/docs/guides/privacy/presidio_data_anonymization/qa_privacy_protection.ipynb)

このノートブックでは、プライベートデータに基づいた基本的な質問応答システムの構築について見ていきます。LLMにこのデータを入力する前に、外部APIに送信されないよう保護する必要があります(例: OpenAI、Anthropic)。その後、モデルの出力を受け取ったら、元の形式に復元したいと思います。以下にこのQAシステムのフローの例を示します:

 Witness: John Doe
 Subject: Testimony Regarding the Loss of Wallet

 Testimony Content:

 Hello Officer,

 My name is John Doe and on October 19, 2021, my wallet was stolen in the vicinity of Kilmarnock during a bike trip. This wallet contains some very important things to me.

 Firstly, the wallet contains my credit card with number 4111 1111 1111 1111, which is registered under my name and linked to my bank account, PL61109010140000071219812874.

 Additionally, the wallet had a driver's license - DL No: 999000680 issued to my name. It also houses my Social Security Number, 602-76-4532.

 What's more, I had my polish identity card there, with the number ABC123456.

 I would like this data to be secured and protected in all possible ways. I believe It was stolen at 9:30 AM.

 In case any information arises regarding my wallet, please reach out to me on my phone number, 999-888-7777, or through my personal email, johndoe@example.com.

 Please consider this information to be highly confidential and respect my privacy.

 The bank has been informed about the stolen credit card and necessary actions have been taken from their end. They will be reachable at their official email, support@bankname.com.
 My representative there is Victoria Cherry (her business phone: 987-654-3210).

 Thank you for your assistance,

 John Doe"""
```

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

documents = [Document(page_content=document_content)]
```

文書は1つしかないので、QAシステムを作る前に、まずはその内容に焦点を当てましょう。

テキストにはさまざまなPII値が含まれていることがわかります。一部のタイプは繰り返し出現し(名前、電話番号、メールアドレスなど)、特定のPIIも繰り返し出現します(John Doe)。

```python
# Util function for coloring the PII markers
# NOTE: It will not be visible on documentation page, only in the notebook
import re


def print_colored_pii(string):
    colored_string = re.sub(
        r"(<[^>]*>)", lambda m: "\033[31m" + m.group(1) + "\033[0m", string
    )
    print(colored_string)
```

デフォルトの設定で匿名化を試してみましょう。今のところ、データを合成データに置き換えるのではなく、マーカー(例: `<PERSON>`)で表示するだけにしましょう。そのため、`add_default_faker_operators=False`に設定します。

```python
from langchain_experimental.data_anonymizer import PresidioReversibleAnonymizer

anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(
    add_default_faker_operators=False,
)

print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))
```

```

元の値と匿名化された値のマッピングも確認してみましょう。

```python
import pprint

pprint.pprint(anonymizer.deanonymizer_mapping)
```

```output
{'CREDIT_CARD': {'<CREDIT_CARD>': '4111 1111 1111 1111'},
 'DATE_TIME': {'<DATE_TIME>': 'October 19, 2021', '<DATE_TIME_2>': '9:30 AM'},
 'EMAIL_ADDRESS': {'<EMAIL_ADDRESS>': 'johndoe@example.com',
                   '<EMAIL_ADDRESS_2>': 'support@bankname.com'},
 'IBAN_CODE': {'<IBAN_CODE>': 'PL61109010140000071219812874'},
 'LOCATION': {'<LOCATION>': 'Kilmarnock'},
 'PERSON': {'<PERSON>': 'John Doe', '<PERSON_2>': 'Victoria Cherry'},
 'PHONE_NUMBER': {'<PHONE_NUMBER>': '999-888-7777'},
 'UK_NHS': {'<UK_NHS>': '987-654-3210'},
 'US_DRIVER_LICENSE': {'<US_DRIVER_LICENSE>': '999000680'},
 'US_SSN': {'<US_SSN>': '602-76-4532'}}
```

全体的に見ると、匿名化機能はうまく機能していますが、2つの改善点が見つかりました:

1. 日時の冗長性 - `DATE_TIME`として認識された2つのエンティティには、異なるタイプの情報が含まれています。1つ目は日付(*2021年10月19日*)、2つ目は時刻(*午前9時30分*)です。時刻を日付から別個に扱う新しい認識子を追加することで、この問題を改善できます。
2. ポーランドのID - ポーランドのIDには固有のパターンがありますが、デフォルトの認識子にはこれが含まれていません。値*ABC123456*は匿名化されていません。

解決策は簡単です。新しい認識子を匿名化機能に追加する必要があります。[presidioのドキュメント](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/analyzer/adding_recognizers/)でその方法を確認できます。

新しい認識子を追加しましょう:

```python
# Define the regex pattern in a Presidio `Pattern` object:
from presidio_analyzer import Pattern, PatternRecognizer

polish_id_pattern = Pattern(
    name="polish_id_pattern",
    regex="[A-Z]{3}\d{6}",
    score=1,
)
time_pattern = Pattern(
    name="time_pattern",
    regex="(1[0-2]|0?[1-9]):[0-5][0-9] (AM|PM)",
    score=1,
)

# Define the recognizer with one or more patterns
polish_id_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(
    supported_entity="POLISH_ID", patterns=[polish_id_pattern]
)
time_recognizer = PatternRecognizer(supported_entity="TIME", patterns=[time_pattern])
```

そして、これらの認識子を匿名化機能に追加します:

```python
anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)
anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)
```

注意点として、匿名化インスタンスは以前に検出および匿名化された値(例: *"午前9時30分"*が`DATE_TIME`として扱われた)を記憶していることです。したがって、この値を削除するか、認識子を更新したら、マッピング全体をリセットするのが良いでしょう。

```python
anonymizer.reset_deanonymizer_mapping()
```

テキストを匿名化して、結果を確認しましょう:

```python
print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))
```

```

新しい認識子が期待通り機能していることがわかります。匿名化機能が時刻とポーランドのIDエンティティを`<TIME>`および`<POLISH_ID>`マーカーに置き換え、deanonymizer マッピングも適切に更新されています。

すべてのPII値が正しく検出されたら、次のステップとして、元の値を合成データに置き換えることができます。そのためには、`add_default_faker_operators=True`を設定する必要があります(または、このパラメーターを削除してもかまいません。デフォルトでは`True`に設定されています)。

```python
anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(
    add_default_faker_operators=True,
    # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes
    # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None)
    faker_seed=42,
)

anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)
anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)

print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))

```

ご覧のとおり、ほとんどすべての値が合成データに置き換えられています。唯一の例外は、ポーランドのID番号と時刻で、これらはデフォルトのFakerオペレーターではサポートされていません。カスタムオペレーターを匿名化機能に追加して、ランダムなデータを生成することができます。カスタムオペレーターの詳細は[こちら](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/tutorial/11_custom_anonymization/)をご覧ください。

```python
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()


def fake_polish_id(_=None):
    return fake.bothify(text="???######").upper()


fake_polish_id()
```

```output
'VTC592627'
```

```python
def fake_time(_=None):
    return fake.time(pattern="%I:%M %p")


fake_time()
```

```output
'03:14 PM'
```

新しく作成したオペレーターを匿名化機能に追加しましょう:

```python
from presidio_anonymizer.entities import OperatorConfig

new_operators = {
    "POLISH_ID": OperatorConfig("custom", {"lambda": fake_polish_id}),
    "TIME": OperatorConfig("custom", {"lambda": fake_time}),
}

anonymizer.add_operators(new_operators)
```

そして、再度すべてを匿名化します:

```python
anonymizer.reset_deanonymizer_mapping()
print_colored_pii(anonymizer.anonymize(document_content))
```

### PII匿名化付きの質問応答システム

最後に、`PresidioReversibleAnonymizer`とLangChain Expression Language (LCEL)を使って、完全な質問応答システムを作成しましょう。

```python
# 1. Initialize anonymizer
anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(
    # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes
    # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None)
    faker_seed=42,
)

anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)
anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)

anonymizer.add_operators(new_operators)
```

```python
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# 2. Load the data: In our case data's already loaded
# 3. Anonymize the data before indexing
for doc in documents:
    doc.page_content = anonymizer.anonymize(doc.page_content)

# 4. Split the documents into chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

# 5. Index the chunks (using OpenAI embeddings, because the data is already anonymized)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
docsearch = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, embeddings)
retriever = docsearch.as_retriever()
```

```python

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.3)


_inputs = RunnableParallel(
    question=RunnablePassthrough(),
    # It is important to remember about question anonymization
    anonymized_question=RunnableLambda(anonymizer.anonymize),

```

```python
print(
    chain_with_deanonymization.invoke("What was the content of the wallet in detail?")
)
```

```output
The content of the wallet included a credit card with the number 4111 1111 1111 1111, registered under the name of John Doe and linked to the bank account PL61109010140000071219812874. It also contained a driver's license with the number 999000680 issued to John Doe, as well as his Social Security Number 602-76-4532. Additionally, the wallet had a Polish identity card with the number ABC123456.

### 別のアプローチ: ローカルな埋め込み + インデックス化後のコンテキストの匿名化

何らかの理由でデータを元の形式でインデックス化したい場合、またはカスタムの埋め込みを使用したい場合は、以下の例を参考にしてください:

```python
anonymizer = PresidioReversibleAnonymizer(
    # Faker seed is used here to make sure the same fake data is generated for the test purposes
    # In production, it is recommended to remove the faker_seed parameter (it will default to None)
    faker_seed=42,
)

anonymizer.add_recognizer(polish_id_recognizer)
anonymizer.add_recognizer(time_recognizer)

anonymizer.add_operators(new_operators)
```

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings

model_name = "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5"
# model_kwargs = {'device': 'cuda'}
encode_kwargs = {"normalize_embeddings": True}  # set True to compute cosine similarity
local_embeddings = HuggingFaceBgeEmbeddings(
    model_name=model_name,
    # model_kwargs=model_kwargs,
    encode_kwargs=encode_kwargs,
    query_instruction="Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:",
)
```

```python
documents = [Document(page_content=document_content)]

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
chunks = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

docsearch = FAISS.from_documents(chunks, local_embeddings)
retriever = docsearch.as_retriever()
```

```python
template = """Answer the question based only on the following context:
{context}

Question: {anonymized_question}
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.2)
```

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import format_document
from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template(template="{page_content}")


def _combine_documents(
    docs, document_prompt=DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_PROMPT, document_separator="\n\n"
):
    doc_strings = [format_document(doc, document_prompt) for doc in docs]
    return document_separator.join(doc_strings)


chain_with_deanonymization = (
    RunnableParallel({"question": RunnablePassthrough()})
    | {
        "context": itemgetter("question")
        | retriever
        | _combine_documents
        | anonymizer.anonymize,
        "anonymized_question": lambda x: anonymizer.anonymize(x["question"]),
    }
    | prompt
    | model
    | StrOutputParser()
    | RunnableLambda(anonymizer.deanonymize)

```

```python
print(
    chain_with_deanonymization.invoke(
        "Where did the theft of the wallet occur, at what time, and who was it stolen from?"
    )
)
```

```output
The theft of the wallet occurred in the vicinity of Kilmarnock during a bike trip. It was stolen from John Doe. The time of the theft was 9:30 AM.
```

```python
print(
    chain_with_deanonymization.invoke("What was the content of the wallet in detail?")
)
```

```output
The content of the wallet included:
1. Credit card number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
2. Bank account number: PL61109010140000071219812874
3. Driver's license number: 999000680
4. Social Security Number: 602-76-4532
5. Polish identity card number: ABC123456
```

```python
print(chain_with_deanonymization.invoke("Whose phone number is it: 999-888-7777?"))
```

```output
The phone number 999-888-7777 belongs to John Doe.
