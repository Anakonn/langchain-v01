# XMLエージェント

一部の言語モデル(Anthropicのクロードなど)は、XMLの推論/書き込みに特に優れています。これは、XMLを使用してプロンプトを行うエージェントの使用方法について説明します。

:::tip

* 通常のLLMと一緒に使用し、チャットモデルとは使用しないでください。
* 構造化されていないツール、つまり単一の文字列入力を受け入れるツールでのみ使用してください。
* その他のエージェントタイプについては、[AgentTypes](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/)のドキュメントを参照してください。
:::

```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_xml_agent
from langchain_anthropic.chat_models import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
```

## ツールの初期化

使用するツールを初期化します。

```python
tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]
```

## エージェントの作成

以下では、LangChainの組み込み[create_xml_agent](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.agents.xml.base.create_xml_agent.html)コンストラクターを使用します。

```python
# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/xml-agent-convo")
```

```python
# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-2.1")

# Construct the XML agent
agent = create_xml_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
```

## エージェントの実行

```python
# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```

```output

```

## チャット履歴での使用

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "what's my name? Only use a tool if needed, otherwise respond with Final Answer",
        # Notice that chat_history is a string, since this prompt is aimed at LLMs, not chat models
        "chat_history": "Human: Hi! My name is Bob\nAI: Hello Bob! Nice to meet you",
    }
)
```

```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3m <final_answer>Your name is Bob.</final_answer>

Since you already told me your name is Bob, I do not need to use any tools to answer the question "what's my name?". I can provide the final answer directly that your name is Bob.[0m

```output
{'input': "what's my name? Only use a tool if needed, otherwise respond with Final Answer",
 'chat_history': 'Human: Hi! My name is Bob\nAI: Hello Bob! Nice to meet you',
 'output': 'Your name is Bob.'}
```

# カスタムXMLエージェント

**注意:** より柔軟性を高めるには、[LangGraph](/docs/langgraph)をチェックすることをお勧めします。

ここでは、`create_xml_agent`が内部で行っていることの感覚を得るために、カスタムXMLエージェントの実装例を示します。

```python
from langchain.agents.output_parsers import XMLAgentOutputParser
```

```python
# Logic for going from intermediate steps to a string to pass into model
# This is pretty tied to the prompt
def convert_intermediate_steps(intermediate_steps):
    log = ""
    for action, observation in intermediate_steps:
        log += (
            f"<tool>{action.tool}</tool><tool_input>{action.tool_input}"
            f"</tool_input><observation>{observation}</observation>"
        )
    return log


# Logic for converting tools to string to go in prompt
def convert_tools(tools):
    return "\n".join([f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}" for tool in tools])
```

実行可能なエージェントを構築するには、通常以下のようなことが必要です:

1. 中間ステップのためのデータ処理。これらは、言語モデルが認識できる方法で表現する必要があります。これはプロンプトの指示に密接に結び付いている必要があります。

2. プロンプト自体

3. モデル(必要に応じてストップトークンを含む)

4. 出力パーサー - プロンプトの指定方法と同期している必要があります。

```python
agent = (
    {
        "input": lambda x: x["input"],
        "agent_scratchpad": lambda x: convert_intermediate_steps(
            x["intermediate_steps"]
        ),
    }
    | prompt.partial(tools=convert_tools(tools))
    | llm.bind(stop=["</tool_input>", "</final_answer>"])
    | XMLAgentOutputParser()
)
```

```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```
