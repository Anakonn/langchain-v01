# 会話バッファ

このノートブックでは、`ConversationBufferMemory`の使用方法を示します。このメモリーは、メッセージを保存し、メッセージを変数で抽出することができます。

まず、文字列として抽出することができます。

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer.ConversationBufferMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

また、メッセージの履歴をメッセージのリストとして取得することもできます(これはチャットモデルと一緒に使用する場合に便利です)。

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## チェーンでの使用

最後に、チェーンでの使用を見てみましょう(`verbose=True`を設定して、プロンプトを確認できるようにします)。

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

```output


    > Entering new ConversationChain chain...
    Prompt after formatting:
    The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

    Current conversation:

    Human: Hi there!
    AI:

    > Finished chain.





    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="I'm doing well! Just having a conversation with an AI.")
```

```output

    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")
```

```output
