# वार्तालाप बफर

यह नोटबुक `ConversationBufferMemory` का उपयोग करने का प्रदर्शन करता है। यह मेमोरी संदेशों को संग्रहित करने और फिर संदेशों को एक चर में निकालने की अनुमति देती है।

हम पहले इसे एक स्ट्रिंग के रूप में निकाल सकते हैं।

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer.ConversationBufferMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

हम इतिहास को संदेशों की एक सूची के रूप में भी प्राप्त कर सकते हैं (यह उपयोगी है यदि आप इसका उपयोग किसी चैट मॉडल के साथ कर रहे हैं)।

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## श्रृंखला में उपयोग करना

अंत में, चलो इसका उपयोग श्रृंखला में देखते हैं (`verbose=True` सेट करके ताकि हम प्रॉम्प्ट को देख सकें)।

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

```output

```python
