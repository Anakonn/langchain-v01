# एकाधिक मेमोरी वर्ग

हम एक ही श्रृंखला में एकाधिक मेमोरी वर्ग का उपयोग कर सकते हैं। एकाधिक मेमोरी वर्ग को संयुक्त करने के लिए, हम `CombinedMemory` क्लास को प्रारंभ और उपयोग करते हैं।

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import (
    CombinedMemory,
    ConversationBufferMemory,
    ConversationSummaryMemory,
)
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

conv_memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history_lines", input_key="input"
)

summary_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=OpenAI(), input_key="input")
# Combined
memory = CombinedMemory(memories=[conv_memory, summary_memory])
_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Summary of conversation:

PROMPT = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["history", "input", "chat_history_lines"],
    template=_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE,
)
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=memory, prompt=PROMPT)
```

```python
conversation.run("Hi!")
```

```output
