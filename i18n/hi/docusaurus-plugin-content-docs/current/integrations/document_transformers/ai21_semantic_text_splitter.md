# AI21SemanticTextSplitter

यह उदाहरण LangChain में AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करने के बारे में बताता है।

## स्थापना

```python
pip install langchain-ai21
```

## पर्यावरण सेटअप

हमें एक AI21 API कुंजी प्राप्त करनी होगी और AI21_API_KEY पर्यावरण चर को सेट करना होगा:

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["AI21_API_KEY"] = getpass()
```

## उदाहरण उपयोग

### सेमांटिक अर्थ द्वारा पाठ को विभाजित करना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे पाठ को सेमांटिक अर्थ के आधार पर टुकड़ों में विभाजित किया जा सकता है।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "
    "legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\n"
    "Imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information "
    "overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise "
    "here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that "
    "reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from "
    "inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of "
    "Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!).\nThis is where AI-driven summarization "
    "tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, "
    "users can (ideally) quickly extract relevant information from a text. With large language models, "
    "the development of those tools is easier than ever, and you can offer your users a summary that is "
    "specifically tailored to their preferences.\nLarge language models naturally follow patterns in input "
    "(prompt), and provide coherent completion that follows the same patterns. For that, we want to feed "
    'them with several examples in the input ("few-shot prompt"), so they can follow through. '
    "The process of creating the correct prompt for your problem is called prompt engineering, "
    "and you can read more about it here."
)

semantic_text_splitter = AI21SemanticTextSplitter()
chunks = semantic_text_splitter.split_text(TEXT)

print(f"The text has been split into {len(chunks)} chunks.")
for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk)
    print("====")
```

### सेमांटिक अर्थ के साथ पाठ को विभाजित करना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे पाठ को सेमांटिक अर्थ के आधार पर टुकड़ों में विभाजित किया जा सकता है, और फिर `chunk_size` के आधार पर टुकड़ों को मर्ज किया जा सकता है।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "
    "legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\n"

semantic_text_splitter_chunks = AI21SemanticTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)
chunks = semantic_text_splitter_chunks.split_text(TEXT)

print(f"The text has been split into {len(chunks)} chunks.")
for chunk in chunks:
    print(chunk)
    print("====")
```

### दस्तावेजों में पाठ को विभाजित करना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे पाठ को दस्तावेजों में सेमांटिक अर्थ के आधार पर विभाजित किया जा सकता है। मेटाडेटा में प्रत्येक दस्तावेज के लिए एक प्रकार होगा।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "
    "legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\n"
    "Imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information "
    "overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise "
    "here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that "
    "reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from "

)

semantic_text_splitter = AI21SemanticTextSplitter()
documents = semantic_text_splitter.split_text_to_documents(TEXT)

print(f"The text has been split into {len(documents)} Documents.")
for doc in documents:
    print(f"type: {doc.metadata['source_type']}")
    print(f"text: {doc.page_content}")
    print("====")
```

### मेटाडेटा के साथ दस्तावेज बनाना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे पाठ से दस्तावेज बनाए जा सकते हैं, और प्रत्येक दस्तावेज में कस्टम मेटाडेटा जोड़ा जा सकता है।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "
    "legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\n"
    "Imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information "
    "overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise "
    "here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that "
    "reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from "
    "inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of "
    "Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!).\nThis is where AI-driven summarization "
    "tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, "

)

semantic_text_splitter = AI21SemanticTextSplitter()
texts = [TEXT]
documents = semantic_text_splitter.create_documents(
    texts=texts, metadatas=[{"pikachu": "pika pika"}]
)

print(f"The text has been split into {len(documents)} Documents.")
for doc in documents:
    print(f"metadata: {doc.metadata}")
    print(f"text: {doc.page_content}")
    print("====")
```

### शुरुआती सूचकांक के साथ दस्तावेजों में पाठ को विभाजित करना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे पाठ को दस्तावेजों में सेमांटिक अर्थ के आधार पर विभाजित किया जा सकता है। मेटाडेटा में प्रत्येक दस्तावेज के लिए एक शुरुआती सूचकांक होगा।
**ध्यान दें** कि शुरुआती सूचकांक प्रत्येक टुकड़े के वास्तविक शुरुआती सूचकांक के बजाय टुकड़ों के क्रम का संकेत देता है।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "
    "legal documents, or terms and conditions (though, who actually reads those terms and conditions to be honest?).\n"
    "Imagine a company that employs hundreds of thousands of employees. In today's information "
    "overload age, nearly 30% of the workday is spent dealing with documents. There's no surprise "
    "here, given that some of these documents are long and convoluted on purpose (did you know that "
    "reading through all your privacy policies would take almost a quarter of a year?). Aside from "
    "inefficiency, workers may simply refrain from reading some documents (for example, Only 16% of "
    "Employees Read Their Employment Contracts Entirely Before Signing!).\nThis is where AI-driven summarization "
    "tools can be helpful: instead of reading entire documents, which is tedious and time-consuming, "

    "and you can read more about it here."
)

semantic_text_splitter = AI21SemanticTextSplitter(add_start_index=True)
documents = semantic_text_splitter.create_documents(texts=[TEXT])
print(f"The text has been split into {len(documents)} Documents.")
for doc in documents:
    print(f"start_index: {doc.metadata['start_index']}")
    print(f"text: {doc.page_content}")
    print("====")
```

### दस्तावेजों को विभाजित करना

यह उदाहरण दिखाता है कि AI21SemanticTextSplitter का उपयोग करके कैसे दस्तावेजों की एक सूची को सेमांटिक अर्थ के आधार पर टुकड़ों में विभाजित किया जा सकता है।

```python
from langchain_ai21 import AI21SemanticTextSplitter
from langchain_core.documents import Document

TEXT = (
    "We’ve all experienced reading long, tedious, and boring pieces of text - financial reports, "

documents = semantic_text_splitter.split_documents([document])
print(f"The document list has been split into {len(documents)} Documents.")
for doc in documents:
    print(f"text: {doc.page_content}")
    print(f"metadata: {doc.metadata}")
    print("====")
```
