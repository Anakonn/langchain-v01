# Kay.ai

>[Kai Data API](https://www.kay.ai/) 는 RAG 🕵️를 위해 만들어졌습니다. 우리는 세계 최대 규모의 데이터셋을 고품질 임베딩으로 큐레이팅하여 AI 에이전트가 즉시 컨텍스트를 검색할 수 있도록 합니다. 최신 모델, 빠른 검색, 그리고 인프라 없음.

이 노트북은 [Kay](https://kay.ai/)에서 지원하는 데이터셋을 검색하는 방법을 보여줍니다. 현재 `SEC 제출 문서` 및 `미국 기업의 보도 자료`를 검색할 수 있습니다. [kay.ai](https://kay.ai)에서 최신 데이터 드롭을 확인하세요. 질문이 있으시면 [discord](https://discord.gg/hAnE4e5T6M) 또는 [트위터](https://twitter.com/vishalrohra_)로 연락주세요.

## 설치

먼저 [`kay` 패키지](https://pypi.org/project/kay/)를 설치하세요.

```python
!pip install kay
```

API 키도 필요합니다: [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai/)에서 무료로 받을 수 있습니다. API 키를 받으면 환경 변수 `KAY_API_KEY`에 설정해야 합니다.

`KayAiRetriever`에는 다음과 같은 인수를 받는 정적 `.create()` 팩토리 메서드가 있습니다:

* `dataset_id: string` 필수 -- Kay 데이터셋 ID. 이는 기업, 사람 또는 장소와 같은 특정 엔티티에 대한 데이터 컬렉션입니다. 예를 들어 `"company"`를 시도해보세요.
* `data_type: List[string]` 선택 -- 데이터의 출처 또는 형식에 따른 데이터셋 내의 카테고리, 예를 들어 "company" 데이터셋 내의 '10-K', '10-Q', 'PressRelease' 등입니다. 비워두면 Kay가 모든 유형에서 가장 관련성 있는 컨텍스트를 검색합니다.
* `num_contexts: int` 선택, 기본값 6 -- `get_relevant_documents()`를 호출할 때 검색할 문서 청크의 수

**Answer**: In 2023, Roku made a strategic partnership with FreeWheel to bring Roku's leading ad tech to FreeWheel customers. This partnership aimed to drive greater interoperability and automation in the advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) space. Key highlights of this collaboration include streamlined integration of Roku's demand application programming interface (dAPI) with FreeWheel's TV platform, allowing for better inventory quality control and improved publisher yield and revenue. Additionally, publishers can now use Roku platform signals to enable advertisers to target audiences and measure campaign performance without relying on cookies. This partnership also involves the use of data clean room technology to enable the activation of additional data sets for better measurement and monetization for publishers and agencies. These partnerships and strategies aim to support Roku's growth in the AVOD market.
