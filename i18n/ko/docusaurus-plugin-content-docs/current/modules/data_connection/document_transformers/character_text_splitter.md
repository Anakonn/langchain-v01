# 문자로 분할하기

이것은 가장 간단한 방법입니다. 이것은 문자(기본적으로 "\n\n")를 기준으로 분할하고 문자 수로 청크 길이를 측정합니다.

1. 텍스트가 어떻게 분할되는지: 단일 문자별로.
2. 청크 크기가 어떻게 측정되는지: 문자 수로.

```python
%pip install -qU langchain-text-splitters
```

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator="\n\n",
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)
```

```python
texts = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(texts[0])
```

```output
page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.'
