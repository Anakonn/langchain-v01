# 구조화된 채팅

구조화된 채팅 에이전트는 다중 입력 도구를 사용할 수 있습니다.

```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_structured_chat_agent
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

## 도구 초기화

Tavily Search를 사용하여 에이전트를 테스트할 것입니다.

```python
tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]
```

## 에이전트 생성

```python
# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/structured-chat-agent")
```

```python
# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106")

# Construct the JSON agent
agent = create_structured_chat_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
```

## 에이전트 실행

```python
# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True
)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```

```output
