# 대화 버퍼 창

`ConversationBufferWindowMemory`는 시간에 따른 대화 상호 작용 목록을 유지합니다. 마지막 K개의 상호 작용만 사용합니다. 이를 통해 가장 최근 상호 작용의 슬라이딩 창을 유지할 수 있어 버퍼가 너무 커지지 않습니다.

이 유형의 메모리의 기본 기능을 먼저 살펴보겠습니다.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferWindowMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer_window.ConversationBufferWindowMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

또한 메시지 목록으로 기록을 가져올 수 있습니다(채팅 모델과 함께 사용하는 데 유용함).

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## 체인에서 사용하기

다시 `verbose=True`로 설정하여 프롬프트를 볼 수 있도록 예제를 살펴보겠습니다.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    # We set a low k=2, to only keep the last 2 interactions in memory
    memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2),
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

```output
