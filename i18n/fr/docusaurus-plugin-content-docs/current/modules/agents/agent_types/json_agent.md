# Agent de chat JSON

Certains modÃ¨les de langage sont particuliÃ¨rement douÃ©s pour Ã©crire du JSON. Cet agent utilise le JSON pour formater ses sorties et vise Ã  prendre en charge les modÃ¨les de chat.

```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_json_chat_agent
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
```

## Initialiser les outils

Nous allons initialiser les outils que nous voulons utiliser

```python
tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]
```

## CrÃ©er un agent

```python
# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react-chat-json")
```

```python
# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatOpenAI()

# Construct the JSON agent
agent = create_json_chat_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
```

## ExÃ©cuter l'agent

```python
# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True, handle_parsing_errors=True
)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```

```output
