# Diviser par caractère

C'est la méthode la plus simple. Cela se divise en fonction des caractères (par défaut "\n\n") et mesure la longueur du fragment par le nombre de caractères.

1. Comment le texte est-il divisé : par caractère unique.
2. Comment la taille du fragment est-elle mesurée : par le nombre de caractères.

```python
%pip install -qU langchain-text-splitters
```

```python
# This is a long document we can split up.
with open("../../state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(
    separator="\n\n",
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    length_function=len,
    is_separator_regex=False,
)
```

```python
texts = text_splitter.create_documents([state_of_the_union])
print(texts[0])
```

```output
page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.'

Voici un exemple de transmission de métadonnées avec les documents, notez qu'il est divisé avec les documents.

```python
metadatas = [{"document": 1}, {"document": 2}]
documents = text_splitter.create_documents(
    [state_of_the_union, state_of_the_union], metadatas=metadatas
)
print(documents[0])
```

```output

```python
text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)[0]
