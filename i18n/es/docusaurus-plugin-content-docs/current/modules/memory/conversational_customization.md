# Personalizar la memoria conversacional

Este cuaderno recorre algunas formas de personalizar la memoria conversacional.

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
```

## Prefijo de IA

La primera forma de hacerlo es cambiando el prefijo de IA en el resumen de la conversaciÃ³n. De forma predeterminada, este se establece en "IA", pero puede establecerlo en lo que desee. Tenga en cuenta que si cambia esto, tambiÃ©n debe cambiar el mensaje utilizado en la cadena para reflejar este cambio de nomenclatura. Vamos a recorrer un ejemplo de eso en el ejemplo a continuaciÃ³n.

```python
# Here it is by default set to "AI"
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm, verbose=True, memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

```output


[1m> Entering new ConversationChain chain...[0m
Prompt after formatting:
[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

Current conversation:

Human: Hi there!
AI:[0m

[1m> Finished ConversationChain chain.[0m
```

```output
" Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="What's the weather?")
```

```output


[1m> Entering new ConversationChain chain...[0m
Prompt after formatting:
[32;1m[1;3mThe following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.

AI:  Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?
Human: What's the weather?

```

```output
' The current weather is sunny and warm with a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The forecast for the next few days is sunny with temperatures in the mid-70s.'
```

```python
# Now we can override it and set it to "AI Assistant"
from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

template = """The following is a friendly conversation between a human and an AI. The AI is talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context. If the AI does not know the answer to a question, it truthfully says it does not know.
