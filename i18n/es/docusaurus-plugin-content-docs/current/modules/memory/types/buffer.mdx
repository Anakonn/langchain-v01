# Búfer de conversación

Este cuaderno muestra cómo usar `ConversationBufferMemory`. Esta memoria permite almacenar mensajes y luego extraer los mensajes en una variable.

Primero podemos extraerlo como una cadena.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer.ConversationBufferMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

También podemos obtener el historial como una lista de mensajes (esto es útil si lo está usando con un modelo de chat).

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## Uso en una cadena

Finalmente, echemos un vistazo a usarlo en una cadena (estableciendo `verbose=True` para que podamos ver el mensaje).

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

```output

    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")
```
