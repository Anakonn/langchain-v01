# BÃºfer de tokens de conversaciÃ³n

`ConversationTokenBufferMemory` mantiene un bÃºfer de interacciones recientes en la memoria y utiliza la longitud del token en lugar del nÃºmero de interacciones para determinar cuÃ¡ndo vaciar las interacciones.

Primero veamos cÃ³mo utilizar los servicios pÃºblicos.

## Uso de la memoria con LLM

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationTokenBufferMemory
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI()
```

```python
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=llm, max_token_limit=10)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
{'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

TambiÃ©n podemos obtener el historial como una lista de mensajes (esto es Ãºtil si lo estÃ¡s usando con un modelo de chat).

```python
memory = ConversationTokenBufferMemory(
    llm=llm, max_token_limit=10, return_messages=True
)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

## Uso en una cadena

Vamos a recorrer un ejemplo, volviendo a establecer `verbose=True` para que podamos ver el mensaje.

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    # We set a very low max_token_limit for the purposes of testing.
    memory=ConversationTokenBufferMemory(llm=OpenAI(), max_token_limit=60),
    verbose=True,
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

```output
