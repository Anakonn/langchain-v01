# LLMRails

>[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/) es una plataforma de API para construir aplicaciones GenAI. Proporciona una API f√°cil de usar para la indexaci√≥n y consulta de documentos que es administrada por LLMRails y est√° optimizada para el rendimiento y la precisi√≥n.
Consulta la [documentaci√≥n de la API de LLMRails](https://docs.llmrails.com/) para obtener m√°s informaci√≥n sobre c√≥mo usar la API.

Este cuaderno muestra c√≥mo usar la funcionalidad relacionada con la integraci√≥n de `LLMRails` con langchain.
Tenga en cuenta que a diferencia de muchas otras integraciones en esta categor√≠a, LLMRails proporciona un servicio administrado de extremo a extremo para la generaci√≥n con recuperaci√≥n aumentada, que incluye:
1. Una forma de extraer texto de archivos de documentos y dividirlos en oraciones.
2. Su propio modelo de incrustaciones y almac√©n de vectores: cada segmento de texto se codifica en un vector de incrustaciones y se almacena en el almac√©n de vectores interno de LLMRails.
3. Un servicio de consulta que codifica autom√°ticamente la consulta en incrustaciones y recupera los segmentos de texto m√°s relevantes (incluido el soporte para [B√∫squeda h√≠brida](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search))).

Todos estos se admiten en esta integraci√≥n de LangChain.

# Configuraci√≥n

Necesitar√° una cuenta de LLMRails para usar LLMRails con LangChain. Para comenzar, siga estos pasos:
1. [Reg√≠strate](https://console.llmrails.com/signup) para obtener una cuenta de LLMRails si a√∫n no tienes una.
2. A continuaci√≥n, deber√°s crear claves API para acceder a la API. Haz clic en la pesta√±a **"Claves API"** en la vista del corpus y luego en el bot√≥n **"Crear clave API"**. Dale un nombre a tu clave. Haz clic en "Crear clave" y ahora tienes una clave API activa. Mant√©n esta clave confidencial.

Para usar LangChain con LLMRails, necesitar√°s tener este valor: api_key.
Puedes proporcionarlos a LangChain de dos formas:

1. Incluye en tu entorno estas dos variables: `LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`, `LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`.

> Por ejemplo, puedes establecer estas variables usando os.environ y getpass de la siguiente manera:

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ["LLM_RAILS_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails API Key:")
os.environ["LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails Datastore Id:")
```

1. Proporci√≥nelos como argumentos al crear el objeto de almac√©n de vectores LLMRails:

```python
vectorstore = LLMRails(
    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,
    datastore_id=datastore_id
)
```

## Agregar texto

Para agregar texto a tu almac√©n de datos, primero debes ir a la p√°gina [Almacenes de datos](https://console.llmrails.com/datastores) y crear uno. Haz clic en el bot√≥n Crear almac√©n de datos y elige un nombre y un modelo de incrustaciones para tu almac√©n de datos. Luego obt√©n el ID de tu almac√©n de datos de la configuraci√≥n del nuevo almac√©n de datos.

```python
%pip install tika

## B√∫squeda de similitud

El escenario m√°s sencillo para usar LLMRails es realizar una b√∫squeda de similitud.

```python
query = "What do you plan to do about national security?"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search(query, k=5)
```

```python
print(found_docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
6  N A T I O N A L S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y Page 7 ¬ê¬ê¬ê¬ê¬ê¬ê

This National Security Strategy lays out our plan to achieve a better future of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world.

Our strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the security of the American people; to expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and to realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life.

We can do none of this alone and we do not have to.

Most nations around the world define their interests in ways that are compatible with ours.

We will build the strongest and broadest possible coalition of nations that seek to cooperate with each other, while competing with those powers that offer a darker vision and thwarting their efforts to threaten our interests.

Our Enduring Role The need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater.

The world is becoming more divided and unstable.

Global increases in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic began have made life more difficult for many.

The basic laws and principles governing relations among nations, including the United Nations Charter and the protection it affords all states from being invaded by their neighbors or having their borders redrawn by force, are under attack.

The risk of conflict between major powers is increasing.

Democracies and autocracies are engaged in a contest to show which system of governance can best deliver for their people and the world.

Competition to develop and deploy foundational technologies that will transform our security and economy is intensifying.

Global cooperation on shared interests has frayed, even as the need for that cooperation takes on existential importance.

The scale of these changes grows with each passing year, as do the risks of inaction.

Although the international environment has become more contested, the United States remains the world‚Äôs leading power.

## B√∫squeda de similitud con puntuaci√≥n

A veces, es posible que queramos realizar la b√∫squeda y tambi√©n obtener una puntuaci√≥n de relevancia para saber qu√© tan bueno es un resultado en particular.

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search_with_score(
    query,
    k=5,
)
```

```python
document, score = found_docs[0]
print(document.page_content)
print(f"\nScore: {score}")
```

```output
But we will do so as the last resort and only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws, alongside non-military tools, and the mission is undertaken with the informed consent of the American people.

Our approach to national defense is described in detail in the 2022 National Defense Strategy.

Our starting premise is that a powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people and their economic interests.

Amid intensifying competition, the military‚Äôs role is to maintain and gain warfighting advantages while limiting those of our competitors.

The military will act urgently to sustain and strengthen deterrence, with the PRC as its pacing challenge.

We will make disciplined choices regarding our national defense and focus our attention on the military‚Äôs primary responsibilities: to defend the homeland, and deter attacks and aggression against the United States, our allies and partners, while being prepared to fight and win the Nation‚Äôs wars should diplomacy and deterrence fail.

To do so, we will combine our strengths to achieve maximum effect in deterring acts of aggression‚Äîan approach we refer to as integrated deterrence (see text box on page 22).

We will operate our military using a campaigning mindset‚Äîsequencing logically linked military activities to advance strategy-aligned priorities.

And, we will build a resilient force and defense ecosystem to ensure we can perform these functions for decades to come.

We ended America‚Äôs longest war in Afghanistan, and with it an era of major military operations to remake other societies, even as we have maintained the capacity to address terrorist threats to the American people as they emerge.

A combat-credible military is the foundation of deterrence and America‚Äôs ability to prevail in conflict.

## LLMRails como un Recuperador

LLMRails, al igual que todos los otros almacenes de vectores de LangChain, se usa con m√°s frecuencia como un Recuperador de LangChain:

```python
retriever = llm_rails.as_retriever()
retriever
```

```output
LLMRailsRetriever(vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.llm_rails.LLMRails object at 0x1235b0e50>)
```

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
retriever.invoke(query)
```

```output
