# BÃºsqueda de Tavily

[La API de bÃºsqueda de Tavily](https://tavily.com) es un motor de bÃºsqueda construido especÃ­ficamente para agentes de IA (LLM), que entrega resultados en tiempo real, precisos y factuales a gran velocidad.

## ConfiguraciÃ³n

La integraciÃ³n se encuentra en el paquete `langchain-community`. TambiÃ©n necesitamos instalar el paquete `tavily-python` en sÃ­.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-community tavily-python
```

TambiÃ©n necesitamos establecer nuestra clave API de Tavily.

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

TambiÃ©n es Ãºtil (pero no necesario) configurar [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) para una observabilidad de primera clase.

```python
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
# os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```
