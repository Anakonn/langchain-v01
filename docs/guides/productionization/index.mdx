This section contains guides around best practices for getting and keeping your application production-ready,

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items.filter((item) => item.href !== "/docs/guides/productionization/")} />
