# Async Chromium

Chromium is one of the browsers supported by Playwright, a library used to control browser automation.

By running `p.chromium.launch(headless=True)`, we are launching a headless instance of Chromium.

Headless mode means that the browser is running without a graphical user interface.

`AsyncChromiumLoader` loads the page, and then we use `Html2TextTransformer` to transform to text.

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  playwright beautifulsoup4
!playwright install
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AsyncChromiumLoader

urls = ["https://www.wsj.com"]
loader = AsyncChromiumLoader(urls)
docs = loader.load()
docs[0].page_content[0:100]
```

```output
'<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en"><head><script src="https://s0.2mdn.net/instream/video/client.js" asyn'
```

If you are using Jupyter notebooks, you might need to apply `nest_asyncio` before loading the documents.

```python
!pip install nest-asyncio
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_transformers import Html2TextTransformer

html2text = Html2TextTransformer()
docs_transformed = html2text.transform_documents(docs)
docs_transformed[0].page_content[0:500]
```
