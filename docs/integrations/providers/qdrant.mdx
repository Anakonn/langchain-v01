# Qdrant

>[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine.
> It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage
> points - vectors with an additional payload. `Qdrant` is tailored to extended filtering support.

## Installation and Setup

Install the Python SDK:

```bash
pip install qdrant-client
```

## Vector Store

There exists a wrapper around `Qdrant` indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "Qdrant", "source": "langchain_community.vectorstores", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.qdrant.Qdrant.html", "title": "Qdrant"}]-->
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Qdrant
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the Qdrant wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/qdrant)
