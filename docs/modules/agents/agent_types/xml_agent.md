# XML Agent

Some language models (like Anthropic's Claude) are particularly good at reasoning/writing XML. This goes over how to use an agent that uses XML when prompting.

:::tip

* Use with regular LLMs, not with chat models.
* Use only with unstructured tools; i.e., tools that accept a single string input.
* See [AgentTypes](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/) documentation for more agent types.
:::

```python
from langchain import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_xml_agent
from langchain_anthropic.chat_models import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
```

## Initialize Tools

We will initialize the tools we want to use

```python
tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]
```

## Create Agent

Below we will use LangChain's built-in [create_xml_agent](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.agents.xml.base.create_xml_agent.html) constructor.

```python
# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/xml-agent-convo")
```

```python
# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-2.1")

# Construct the XML agent
agent = create_xml_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
```

## Run Agent

```python
# Create an agent executor by passing in the agent and tools
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```

```output

## Using with chat history

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "what's my name? Only use a tool if needed, otherwise respond with Final Answer",
        # Notice that chat_history is a string, since this prompt is aimed at LLMs, not chat models
        "chat_history": "Human: Hi! My name is Bob\nAI: Hello Bob! Nice to meet you",
    }
)
```

```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3m <final_answer>Your name is Bob.</final_answer>

Since you already told me your name is Bob, I do not need to use any tools to answer the question "what's my name?". I can provide the final answer directly that your name is Bob.[0m

```

```output
{'input': "what's my name? Only use a tool if needed, otherwise respond with Final Answer",
 'chat_history': 'Human: Hi! My name is Bob\nAI: Hello Bob! Nice to meet you',
 'output': 'Your name is Bob.'}
```

# Custom XML Agents

**Note:** For greater customizability, we recommend checking out [LangGraph](/docs/langgraph).

Here we provide an example of a custom XML Agent implementation, to give a sense for what `create_xml_agent` is doing under the hood.

```python
from langchain.agents.output_parsers import XMLAgentOutputParser
```

```python
# Logic for going from intermediate steps to a string to pass into model
# This is pretty tied to the prompt
def convert_intermediate_steps(intermediate_steps):
    log = ""
    for action, observation in intermediate_steps:
        log += (
            f"<tool>{action.tool}</tool><tool_input>{action.tool_input}"
            f"</tool_input><observation>{observation}</observation>"
        )
    return log


# Logic for converting tools to string to go in prompt
def convert_tools(tools):
    return "\n".join([f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}" for tool in tools])
```

Building an agent from a runnable usually involves a few things:

1. Data processing for the intermediate steps. These need to be represented in a way that the language model can recognize them. This should be pretty tightly coupled to the instructions in the prompt

2. The prompt itself

3. The model, complete with stop tokens if needed

4. The output parser - should be in sync with how the prompt specifies things to be formatted.

```python
agent = (
    {
        "input": lambda x: x["input"],
        "agent_scratchpad": lambda x: convert_intermediate_steps(
            x["intermediate_steps"]
        ),
    }
    | prompt.partial(tools=convert_tools(tools))
    | llm.bind(stop=["</tool_input>", "</final_answer>"])
    | XMLAgentOutputParser()
)
```

```python
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "what is LangChain?"})
```

LangChain is a platform developed by Anthropic that enables users to build NLP applications by linking large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to external data sources. It provides modules for managing and integrating different components needed for NLP apps.

Some key capabilities and features of LangChain:

- Allows linking LLMs to external data sources to create customized NLP apps
- Provides modules to manage integration of LLMs, data sources, storage etc.
- Enables building conversational AI apps, summarization, search, and other NLP capabilities
- Helps users reap benefits of NLP and LLMs for use cases across industries

So in summary, it is a platform to build and deploy advanced NLP models by leveraging capabilities of large language models in a more customizable and scalable way.
