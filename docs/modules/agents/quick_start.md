# Quickstart

To best understand the agent framework, let's build an agent that has two tools: one to look things up online, and one to look up specific data that we've loaded into a index.

This will assume knowledge of [LLMs](/docs/modules/model_io/) and [retrieval](/docs/modules/data_connection/) so if you haven't already explored those sections, it is recommended you do so.

## Setup: LangSmith

By definition, agents take a self-determined, input-dependent sequence of steps before returning a user-facing output. This makes debugging these systems particularly tricky, and observability particularly important. [LangSmith](/docs/langsmith) is especially useful for such cases.

When building with LangChain, all steps will automatically be traced in LangSmith.
To set up LangSmith we just need set the following environment variables:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"
```

## Define tools

We first need to create the tools we want to use. We will use two tools: [Tavily](/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search) (to search online) and then a retriever over a local index we will create

### [Tavily](/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search)

We have a built-in tool in LangChain to easily use Tavily search engine as tool.
Note that this requires an API key - they have a free tier, but if you don't have one or don't want to create one, you can always ignore this step.

Once you create your API key, you will need to export that as:

```bash
export TAVILY_API_KEY="..."
```

```python
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
```

```python
search = TavilySearchResults()
```

```python
search.invoke("what is the weather in SF")
```

```output

```

### Retriever

We will also create a retriever over some data of our own. For a deeper explanation of each step here, see [this section](/docs/modules/data_connection/).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

loader = WebBaseLoader("https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview")
docs = loader.load()
documents = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200
).split_documents(docs)
vector = FAISS.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vector.as_retriever()
```

```python
retriever.invoke("how to upload a dataset")[0]
```

```output
Document(page_content='import Clientfrom langsmith.evaluation import evaluateclient = Client()# Define dataset: these are your test casesdataset_name = "Sample Dataset"dataset = client.create_dataset(dataset_name, description="A sample dataset in LangSmith.")client.create_examples(    inputs=[        {"postfix": "to LangSmith"},        {"postfix": "to Evaluations in LangSmith"},    ],    outputs=[        {"output": "Welcome to LangSmith"},        {"output": "Welcome to Evaluations in LangSmith"},    ],    dataset_id=dataset.id,)# Define your evaluatordef exact_match(run, example):    return {"score": run.outputs["output"] == example.outputs["output"]}experiment_results = evaluate(    lambda input: "Welcome " + input[\'postfix\'], # Your AI system goes here    data=dataset_name, # The data to predict and grade over    evaluators=[exact_match], # The evaluators to score the results    experiment_prefix="sample-experiment", # The name of the experiment    metadata={      "version": "1.0.0",      "revision_id":', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/overview', 'title': 'Getting started with LangSmith | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'Introduction', 'language': 'en'})
```

Now that we have populated our index that we will do doing retrieval over, we can easily turn it into a tool (the format needed for an agent to properly use it)

```python
from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool
```

```python
retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever,
    "langsmith_search",
    "Search for information about LangSmith. For any questions about LangSmith, you must use this tool!",
)
```

### Tools

Now that we have created both, we can create a list of tools that we will use downstream.

```python
tools = [search, retriever_tool]
```

## Create the agent

Now that we have defined the tools, we can create the agent. We will be using an OpenAI Functions agent - for more information on this type of agent, as well as other options, see [this guide](/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/).

First, we choose the LLM we want to be guiding the agent.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
```

Next, we choose the prompt we want to use to guide the agent.

If you want to see the contents of this prompt and have access to LangSmith, you can go to:

https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/openai-functions-agent

```python
from langchain import hub

# Get the prompt to use - you can modify this!
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
prompt.messages
```

```output
[SystemMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template='You are a helpful assistant')),
 MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name='chat_history', optional=True),
 HumanMessagePromptTemplate(prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['input'], template='{input}')),
 MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name='agent_scratchpad')]
```

Now, we can initialize the agent with the LLM, the prompt, and the tools. The agent is responsible for taking in input and deciding what actions to take. Crucially, the Agent does not execute those actions - that is done by the AgentExecutor (next step). For more information about how to think about these components, see our [conceptual guide](/docs/modules/agents/concepts/).

```python
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
```

Finally, we combine the agent (the brains) with the tools inside the AgentExecutor (which will repeatedly call the agent and execute tools).

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

## Run the agent

We can now run the agent on a few queries! Note that for now, these are all **stateless** queries (it won't remember previous interactions).

```python
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "hi!"})
```

```output

```output

```

```python

```

## Adding in memory

As mentioned earlier, this agent is stateless. This means it does not remember previous interactions. To give it memory we need to pass in previous `chat_history`. Note: it needs to be called `chat_history` because of the prompt we are using. If we use a different prompt, we could change the variable name

```python
# Here we pass in an empty list of messages for chat_history because it is the first message in the chat
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "hi! my name is bob", "chat_history": []})
```

```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mHello Bob! How can I assist you today?[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'input': 'hi! my name is bob',
 'chat_history': [],
 'output': 'Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?'}
```

```python
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "chat_history": [
            HumanMessage(content="hi! my name is bob"),
            AIMessage(content="Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?"),
        ],
        "input": "what's my name?",
    }
)
```

```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mYour name is Bob. How can I assist you, Bob?[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'chat_history': [HumanMessage(content='hi! my name is bob'),
  AIMessage(content='Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?')],
 'input': "what's my name?",
 'output': 'Your name is Bob. How can I assist you, Bob?'}
```

If we want to keep track of these messages automatically, we can wrap this in a RunnableWithMessageHistory. For more information on how to use this, see [this guide](/docs/expression_language/how_to/message_history/).

```python
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
```

```python
message_history = ChatMessageHistory()
```

```python
agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    # This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed
    # It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory
    lambda session_id: message_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)
```

```python
agent_with_chat_history.invoke(
    {"input": "hi! I'm bob"},
    # This is needed because in most real world scenarios, a session id is needed
    # It isn't really used here because we are using a simple in memory ChatMessageHistory
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "<foo>"}},
)
```

## Conclusion

That's a wrap! In this quick start we covered how to create a simple agent. Agents are a complex topic, and there's lot to learn! Head back to the [main agent page](/docs/modules/agents/) to find more resources on conceptual guides, different types of agents, how to create custom tools, and more!
