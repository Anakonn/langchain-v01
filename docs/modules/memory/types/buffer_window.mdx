# Conversation Buffer Window

`ConversationBufferWindowMemory` keeps a list of the interactions of the conversation over time. It only uses the last K interactions. This can be useful for keeping a sliding window of the most recent interactions, so the buffer does not get too large.

Let's first explore the basic functionality of this type of memory.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferWindowMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer_window.ConversationBufferWindowMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: not much you\nAI: not much'}
```

We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).

```python
memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory( k=1, return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
memory.save_context({"input": "not much you"}, {"output": "not much"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='not much you', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='not much', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## Using in a chain

Let's walk through an example, again setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer Window"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
conversation_with_summary = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(temperature=0),
    # We set a low k=2, to only keep the last 2 interactions in memory
    memory=ConversationBufferWindowMemory(k=2),
    verbose=True
)
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="Hi, what's up?")
```

```output

    " Yes, it's going well so far. We've already identified the problem and are now working on a solution."

```python
# Notice here that the first interaction does not appear.
conversation_with_summary.predict(input="What's the solution?")
