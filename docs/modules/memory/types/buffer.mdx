# Conversation Buffer

This notebook shows how to use `ConversationBufferMemory`. This memory allows for storing messages and then extracts the messages in a variable.

We can first extract it as a string.

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ConversationBufferMemory", "source": "langchain.memory", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/memory/langchain.memory.buffer.ConversationBufferMemory.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': 'Human: hi\nAI: whats up'}
```

We can also get the history as a list of messages (this is useful if you are using this with a chat model).

```python
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
memory.save_context({"input": "hi"}, {"output": "whats up"})
```

```python
memory.load_memory_variables({})
```

```output
    {'history': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}),
      AIMessage(content='whats up', additional_kwargs={})]}
```

## Using in a chain

Finally, let's take a look at using this in a chain (setting `verbose=True` so we can see the prompt).

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "OpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_openai.llms.base.OpenAI.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}, {"imported": "ConversationChain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversation.base.ConversationChain.html", "title": "Conversation Buffer"}]-->
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain


llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Hi there!")
```

```output

    " Hi there! It's nice to meet you. How can I help you today?"

```

    " That's great! It's always nice to have a conversation with someone new. What would you like to talk about?"
```

```python
conversation.predict(input="Tell me about yourself.")
```
